The question is: Red Deer or Sylvan Lake?<br/><br/>Red Deer means 45+ minutes, city traffic, and navigating to whichever shop you're trying to find. Sylvan Lake means 20 minutes on a highway you already know, a shop that's been here since 2006, and you're back home before lunch."

      </div>

      <div class="prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert max-w-none text-muted dark:text-slate-400">
        <p>Eckville is a community with deep roots. Settled by Estonian and Finnish homesteaders in the early 1900s, the town moved to its current location in 1912 when the Canadian Northern Railway came through. Today, about 1,100 people call Eckville home, with a broader trading area of around 7,000 residents.</p>
        <p>The local economy still centres on agriculture and oil and gas, which means a lot of trucks and work vehicles that need reliable maintenance. We see Eckville-area vehicles regularly — they tend to be trucks and SUVs that work for a living, and we treat them accordingly.</p>
        <p>Eckville is also a gateway to the west country. People heading to or from Rocky Mountain House, Nordegg, and Abraham Lake on the David Thompson Highway pass right through. If you're prepping a vehicle for a mountain trip or need post-trip maintenance, we're right on your route home.</p>
