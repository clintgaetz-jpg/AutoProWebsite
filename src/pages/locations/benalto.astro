      </div>

      <div class="prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert max-w-none text-muted dark:text-slate-400">
        <p>Benalto is a small hamlet in Red Deer County, situated between Sylvan Lake and Red Deer. It's a quiet rural community surrounded by farmland and acreages, with residents who appreciate the space and slower pace of country living.</p>
        <p>The area attracts people who want to be close to larger centres while maintaining that rural Alberta lifestyle. That often means trucks, SUVs, and vehicles that handle gravel roads and country driving.</p>
        <p>We see vehicles from Benalto and the surrounding Red Deer County area regularly. They tend to be working vehicles that need reliable maintenance — and that's exactly what we provide.</p>
