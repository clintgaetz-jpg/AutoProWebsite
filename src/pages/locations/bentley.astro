      </div>

      <div class="prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert max-w-none text-muted dark:text-slate-400">
        <p>Bentley is a small village in Lacombe County with a population of about 1,100. Situated between Sylvan Lake and Lacombe on Highway 11A, it's a quiet community with deep agricultural roots.</p>
        <p>The area is popular with acreage owners who want rural living with easy access to larger centres. Gull Lake Provincial Park is just south of town, making Bentley a hub for lake-goers in the summer months.</p>
        <p>We see plenty of vehicles from the Bentley area — trucks that haul trailers, SUVs that handle gravel roads, and family vehicles that do a bit of everything. We treat them all with the same attention to detail.</p>
