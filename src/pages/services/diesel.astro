        <p>Diesel engines are built tough, but they need technicians who understand their unique systems — higher compression, turbocharging, complex fuel injection, and emissions controls that gas engines don't have. Getting diesel work done wrong costs serious money.</p>
        <p>At Sylvan Lake AUTOPRO, our technicians have the diagnostic tools and hands-on experience to handle everything from routine diesel maintenance to complex head gasket repairs, turbo replacements, and exhaust system work. We service all makes — Duramax, Cummins, Power Stroke — trucks, equipment, and commercial vehicles.</p>
        <p>For customers looking for performance tuning or custom work, we partner with a trusted local diesel performance shop. They handle the specialty builds while we take care of everything else — giving you one-stop diesel service without compromise.</p>
