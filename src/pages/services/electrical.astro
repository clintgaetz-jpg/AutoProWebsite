  <Content
    title="Your Vehicle Runs on Electricity"
    content="Modern vehicles run on electricity as much as they run on fuel. Dozens of computers, hundreds of sensors, miles of wiring — all of it needs to work correctly for your vehicle to start, run, and keep you comfortable.<br/><br/>When something electrical fails, it can be straightforward (dead battery) or frustrating (intermittent issue that comes and goes). We handle both. <strong>Our technicians are experienced with electrical diagnosis and repair — including the complicated stuff other shops don't want to touch.</strong>"

Sometimes a 'bad starter' is actually a bad connection, weak battery, or wiring issue. If the starter is the problem, we replace it with a quality unit."

Alternator problems can also be caused by bad wiring, loose connections, or a slipping belt — we check the whole system before recommending replacement."
