  <Content
    title="Fluids Beyond Engine Oil"
    content="If your vehicle has four-wheel drive, all-wheel drive, or a CVT transmission, there are fluids beyond engine oil and transmission fluid that need attention. Front and rear differentials, transfer cases, and CVT units all have their own lubricants — and they all wear out.<br/><br/>These services don't get talked about much. Most people don't think about differential fluid until something starts whining or grinding. By then, you're looking at bearing damage or gear wear that could have been prevented.<br/><br/>We service all of it. And we take the fluids seriously."
  />

  <!-- Right Fluids Section -->
  <Content
    title="Full Synthetic. OEM When Required. No Shortcuts."
    content="Driveline components are expensive to replace. Differentials, transfer cases, and CVT transmissions cost thousands of dollars when they fail. The fluid that protects them costs a fraction of that.<br/><br/>We use <strong>full synthetic gear oils</strong> for differential and transfer case services — better protection under load, better performance in cold weather, longer service life.<br/><br/><strong>But here's the thing:</strong> some newer vehicles require OEM-specific fluids. Certain CVT transmissions, for example, have specifications that no aftermarket fluid meets. Using the wrong fluid can cause shudder, slipping, or premature wear.<br/><br/>We check the specs. If your vehicle requires OEM fluid, that's what goes in. No substitutes, no 'compatible' alternatives.<br/><br/><strong>This is what taking fluids seriously looks like.</strong>"

  <!-- Differential Service Section -->
  <Content
    title="Differential Fluid Service — Front & Rear"
    content="Your differentials allow your wheels to turn at different speeds when cornering. They're full of gears and bearings, all running in gear oil that breaks down over time from heat, moisture, and metal particles.<br/><br/>Neglected differential fluid leads to worn bearings, damaged gears, and eventually a differential that needs to be rebuilt or replaced. A fluid service costs a fraction of that repair."

  <!-- Transfer Case Service Section -->
  <Content
    title="Transfer Case Service"
    content="The transfer case is what makes your 4x4 or AWD system work — it splits power between the front and rear axles. Like differentials, it runs on gear oil that breaks down over time.<br/><br/>Transfer cases are often overlooked because they're out of sight. But a failed transfer case is a <strong>$2,000–$4,000 repair</strong>. Fluid service is cheap insurance."

  <!-- AWD Service Section -->
  <Content
    title="All-Wheel Drive (AWD) Service"
    content="Modern AWD systems vary widely — some use a center differential, some use clutch packs, some use electronic coupling units. What they all have in common: fluid that needs to be changed.<br/><br/>AWD systems work constantly, even when you don't notice them. The fluid wears out from heat and use, and when it does, you'll notice shudder during turns, delayed engagement, or that 'binding' feeling in parking lots."

  <Content
    title="CVT Transmission Service"
    content="CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) units are everywhere now — Nissan, Subaru, Honda, Toyota, Mitsubishi, and others use them extensively. They're efficient, but they're also sensitive to fluid condition.<br/><br/>CVT fluid is specialized. It's not the same as regular automatic transmission fluid. Using the wrong fluid — or running too long on worn fluid — causes belt/chain slippage, shudder, and premature failure.<br/><br/><strong>CVT replacements are expensive. $4,000–$7,000 is common.</strong> Fluid service is a fraction of that."
