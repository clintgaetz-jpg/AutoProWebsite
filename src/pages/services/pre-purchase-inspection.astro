  <!-- What We Find Section -->

    title="What We Actually Find"
    content="These aren't rare catastrophic failures. This is regular stuff that adds up fast:<br/><br/><strong>'It drives fine'</strong><br/>Until you find out the front brakes are metal-on-metal. Rotors, pads, possibly calipers. $600-$800 you didn't budget for.<br/><br/><strong>'Just had the oil changed'</strong><br/>Great, but the lower control arm bushings are shot and it needs an alignment. Another $800-$1,000.<br/><br/><strong>'Runs great'</strong><br/>Sure, but there's a transmission code stored that the seller cleared before you test drove it. That's a $3,000+ problem waiting.<br/><br/><strong>This is a regular Tuesday for us.</strong> A $160 inspection saves you thousands—or gives you leverage to negotiate."

  <!-- When to Get Inspection Section -->
  <Content
    title="When to Get an Inspection"
    content="<strong>Private Sales</strong><br/>Most critical. No warranty, no recourse. Once you hand over the money, you own whatever problems come with it.<br/><br/><strong>Dealership Purchases</strong><br/>Yes, even from a dealer. Dealership inspections vary in quality. An independent inspection from a shop with no stake in the sale gives you unbiased information.<br/><br/><strong>Out-of-Town Purchases</strong><br/>Buying from Calgary, Edmonton, or elsewhere? Give us a call. Through the NAPA AUTOPRO network, we may be able to recommend a trusted shop near the vehicle who can inspect it for you."

If it finds problems, you just saved yourself from a bad purchase—or got leverage to negotiate the price down.<br/><br/>Either way, you win."
