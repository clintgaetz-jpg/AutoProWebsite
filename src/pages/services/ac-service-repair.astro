    content="We diagnose and repair automotive air conditioning systems at our Sylvan Lake shop. We service all refrigerant types—<strong>R-134a and the newer R-1234yf</strong> systems that require specialized equipment many shops don't have.<br/><br/>A/C problems range from simple (low refrigerant from a slow leak) to complex (compressor failure, blend door actuators, electronic control issues). We figure out what's actually wrong before recommending repairs. Get your A/C checked now—waiting until July means competing with everyone else who waited."

    title="Why Alberta Is Hard on A/C Systems"
    content="You'd think A/C problems would be a hot-climate issue. Alberta actually creates unique challenges:<br/><br/><strong>Extended Dormancy:</strong> We barely use A/C for eight months of the year. Seals dry out when the system sits idle. When you finally turn it on in June, that's when problems appear.<br/><br/><strong>Temperature Extremes:</strong> Going from -30°C to +30°C stresses every seal, hose, and fitting. Expansion and contraction eventually cause leaks.<br/><br/><strong>Road Debris:</strong> Alberta roads throw rocks. The condenser sits right behind the grille, taking direct hits.<br/><br/><strong>Expensive Refrigerant:</strong> Modern R-1234yf costs significantly more than older R-134a. Finding and fixing leaks properly is more important than ever."

    title="Why DIY Recharge Kits Are a Bad Idea"

Here's why:<br/><br/>• <strong>Overcharge the system</strong> — Damages components<br/>• <strong>Contaminate the refrigerant</strong> — We can't service it with our equipment<br/>• <strong>Include 'stop leak' chemicals</strong> — Clogs components<br/>• <strong>Don't fix the actual leak</strong> — Just delays the real repair<br/><br/>What seems like a $40 money-saver often creates hundreds in additional expense, or leaves us unable to service your vehicle until the contaminated refrigerant is evacuated with special equipment."
