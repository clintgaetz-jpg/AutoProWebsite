    title="We're in the Business of Making Vehicles Last"
    content="Your vehicle doesn't just run on gasoline. It runs on transmission fluid, coolant, brake fluid, power steering fluid, and differential fluid. Every one of these breaks down over time — from heat, moisture, contamination, and just plain use.<br/><br/>Most people know about oil changes. Fewer think about the rest.<br/><br/>We use <strong>BG Products</strong> for our fluid services — professional-grade chemistry designed to clean, flush, and protect. Not the cheapest option, but the one that actually works. BG backs their services with a <strong>Lifetime Protection Plan</strong> that covers component failure up to $4,000–$6,000 if you keep up with maintenance."

    title="Your Vehicle, Your Call"
    content="We get it — people approach maintenance differently.<br/><br/>Some customers bring in their owner's manual and follow the schedule to the letter. Some prefer to stick with the basics and skip the extras. Most are somewhere in between.<br/><br/><strong>All of that is fine with us.</strong><br/><br/>Here's how we see our job: we recommend what we think is best to make your vehicle last. You decide what actually gets done. No pressure, no judgment.<br/><br/>Here's the thing — we're all keeping vehicles longer than we used to. The average vehicle on the road is over 12 years old now. When you're planning to drive something for 200,000+ km, preventive maintenance stops being optional. It's what keeps a $4,000 transmission from failing at 180,000 km instead of lasting to 300,000."

  <!-- Transmission Service Section -->
  <Content
    title="BG Transmission Service"
    content="Your transmission is one of the most expensive components in your vehicle. It's also one of the most neglected.<br/><br/>Transmission fluid breaks down from heat and use. As it degrades, it loses its ability to lubricate, cool, and maintain hydraulic pressure. Deposits form on valve bodies and clutch packs. Shifting gets harder. Eventually, things start slipping.<br/><br/><strong>A transmission rebuild can cost $3,000–$6,000. A fluid service costs a fraction of that.</strong><br/><br/><em>Already having transmission problems?</em> <a href='/services/transmission-repair' class='text-primary hover:underline font-semibold'>Learn about our transmission repair & rebuild services →</a>"

  <!-- Coolant Service Section -->
  <Content
    isReversed={true}
    title="BG Cooling System Service"
    content="Coolant doesn't just keep your engine from overheating — it protects against corrosion, lubricates the water pump, and keeps your heater working in January.<br/><br/>Over time, coolant becomes acidic as its additives deplete. This leads to internal corrosion, scale buildup, and deposits that restrict flow. Left unchecked, you're looking at heater core failures, water pump failures, and overheating — all expensive repairs that start with neglected coolant."
    items={[
      { title: 'Interval', description: 'Every 50,000 km' },

  />

  <!-- Brake Fluid Service Section -->
  <Content
    title="BG Brake Fluid Service"
    content="Brake fluid is hygroscopic — it absorbs moisture from the air. Over time, that moisture lowers the boiling point of your brake fluid and causes internal corrosion in your brake lines, calipers, and master cylinder.<br/><br/>Contaminated brake fluid leads to spongy pedal feel, reduced braking performance, and eventually component failure. In Alberta's climate, with our temperature swings and road salt, this happens faster than you'd think."

  <!-- Fuel System Service Section -->
  <Content
    isReversed={true}
    title="BG Fuel System Service"
    content="Carbon deposits are a fact of life in modern engines. They form on fuel injectors, throttle bodies, intake valves, and combustion chambers. As they build up, you lose fuel efficiency, power, and throttle response.<br/><br/>This is especially true for <strong>GDI (Gasoline Direct Injection)</strong> engines, where fuel doesn't wash over the intake valves. Carbon builds up fast, and there's no easy way to remove it without professional service.<br/><br/><strong>BG Platinum Fuel System Service:</strong> Cleans injectors, throttle body, valves, and combustion chambers.
