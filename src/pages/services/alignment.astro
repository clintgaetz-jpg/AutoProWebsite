    content="Getting alignment numbers 'in the green' is straightforward. Any shop with an alignment rack can do that.<br/><br/><strong>Making your vehicle actually drive straight? That takes more.</strong><br/><br/>It takes understanding how the angles interact. It takes patience to get the steering wheel centered while the thrust angle is correct while the toe is set properly. It takes knowing when factory specs aren't quite right for how a vehicle has aged or been used.<br/><br/>We invest in the best equipment and take the time to do alignments properly — not just technically correct, but actually right."

  <!-- What Makes a Good Alignment Section -->
  <Content
    title="It's Not Just About the Numbers"
    content="Here's the thing about alignments: the computer can show all green, 'in spec' numbers, and your vehicle can still pull to one side or the steering wheel can be off-center.<br/><br/><strong>Why?</strong><br/><br/>Because alignment is about how multiple angles work together — camber, caster, toe, thrust angle, and steering axis inclination all interact. Changing one affects the others. Getting them all correct AND getting the vehicle to track straight with a centered steering wheel takes experience and patience."
