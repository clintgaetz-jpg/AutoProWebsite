  <Content
    title="Not Another Exchange Unit"
    content="Most shops handle transmission problems the same way: diagnose a failure, order an exchange unit, swap it in. You pay for a 'new' transmission that's actually a remanufactured unit of unknown quality, and your original goes back as a core.<br/><br/><strong>We don't work that way.</strong><br/><br/>We diagnose the actual problem. We test. If a rebuild is needed, we send your transmission to our builder — a specialist with <strong>49 years of experience</strong> — who disassembles it, documents what's wrong, and fixes what needs fixing. You get pictures. You get options. You get your transmission back, built right."
