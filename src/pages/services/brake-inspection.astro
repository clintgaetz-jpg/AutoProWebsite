You'll receive a digital report with photos of your actual brakes and color-coded status for each component.<br/><br/>This isn't a quick glance through your wheel spokes. It's a thorough inspection that tells you exactly what condition your brakes are in and what (if anything) they need. No guessing. No surprises."

    content={`You've seen shops advertising "free brake inspections." Here's why we don't—and why that's actually better for you.<br/><br/><strong>What a "free" inspection really means:</strong> A quick visual look without removing the wheels. Someone peers through your wheel spokes and says "looks okay" or "pads are getting low."<br/><br/><strong>What you can't see without taking things apart:</strong><br/>• Whether your caliper is seized<br/>• If your rotors are thick enough to machine<br/>• Whether caliper pistons are leaking<br/>• If your slides are moving freely<br/>• The actual pad thickness in millimeters<br/><br/><strong>Our approach:</strong> We pull the wheels, disassemble everything, measure with actual tools, photograph what we find, and send you a digital report. When we quote your repair, we know exactly what's needed. No surprises.`}
