  <!-- Who We Are -->
  <Content
    title="Locally Owned Since 2006"
    content={`Sylvan Lake AUTOPRO was founded in 2006 and remains owned by the same people who started it: <strong>Wolfgang Kukowski</strong> and <strong>Clint and Alaina Gaetz</strong>.<br/><br/>Nineteen years. Same ownership. Same commitment.<br/><br/>In an industry where shops change hands constantly—where you never know who's working on your vehicle or whether they'll be around next year—we're still here. Still showing up. Still standing behind our work.<br/><br/>That kind of stability isn't an accident. It's the result of doing things right, treating people fairly, and building a business we're proud of.`}
